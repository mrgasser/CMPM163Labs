The cube on the left and the cube in the middle I created by following the lab document. The cube on the right I created using a new material, changed the color and set its wiremesh = to true. The cube on the bottom that has changing colors I made by making two new shader files. Then inside of the animate function I have a counter that goes from 0 to 1 by .005 and each time updates the red and green values for one of the cubes colors causing the color changing effect.
