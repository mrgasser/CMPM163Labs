The first three cubes I made following the instructions on the lab document. The cube on the bottom that has changing colors I made by making two new shader files. Then inside of the animate function I have a counter that goes from 0 to 1 by .005 and each time updates the red and green values for one of the cubes colors causing the color changing effect.
