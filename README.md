The cube on the left and the cube in the middle I created by following the lab document. The cube on the right I created using a new material, changed the color and set its wiremesh = to true. The cube on the bottom that has changing colors I made by making two new shader files. Then inside of the animate function I have a counter that goes from 0 to 1 by .005 and each time updates the red and green values for one of the cubes colors causing the color changing effect.

24a. To find the x coordinate we would take the floor of 7 * u.  
24b. To find the y coordinate value we would take the floor of -7v + 7.  
24c. from (.375, .25) on the uv grid I got (2, 5) on the texture resulting in the color gray.  
The cube in the center was made through the lab document instructions, it contains both the texture and the normal. The cube on the right was also made following the insctructions and only contains the texture and not the normal. The cube on the right was created by me using both the normal and the texture but a different ones from the first two cubes. I created this cube similar to the cube in the center by following the document instructions. The cube on the bottom was created by using a fragment shader and vertex shader as described in the document instructions. The final cube above the center cube I created by making my own shaders. In order to make the tiling work I took my vUv and modded it by .25, this is what enable it to be sampled 4 times across. Then I multiplied that by 4 so that it was scalled properly.
